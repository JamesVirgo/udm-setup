    parameters:
      - name: constraints
        title: Constraints
        description: Seperated string for UDM constraint layers. Name of layer and a treshold value (% of the cell covered which prevents the cell from being used). e.g greenbelt:0.5;sssi:20;

        type: string
        description: String for UDM current development layer, including threshold for % coverage at which cell is considered developed.
        default: 'None'
        required: true

      - name: attractors
        title: Attractors (for future development)
