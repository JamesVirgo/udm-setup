  summary: Allows for data preparation for inputs into the full UDM model.
  description: >
    The model allow for vector data to be rasterized to a common fishnet/grid as required for inputs into the UDM (Urban
    Development model). Data to be rasterized can be supplied as vector files (.geojson, .gpkg) and using the same input
    grid, supplied in a similar vector format (.geojson, .gpkg), will each be output as rasters (as .tif).

    Further updates will add additional features including using data from NISMOD-DB API to generate a fishnet to be used
    and also for the input vector data to be rasterized.
